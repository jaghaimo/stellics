# Stellar Logistics

Stellar Logistics mod adds a convenient courier service which gives the player a limited remote access to their storages.
Using those services player can request cargo or ships from any owned storage, or transfer cargo or ships to any owned storage.
In either case a fee dependant on distance between the player fleet and selected storage will be deducted at the end of the month.
