# Stellar Logistics

Stellar Logistics allows for a convenient browsing of the player's storage content letting the player to quickly locate cargo and ships.
Additionally, the player can define a master storage, where all cargo and ships from other storages will be transfered to.
Any transfer of cargo or ships will incur a fee (depends on the distance between the player fleet and selected storage) that will be collected at the end of the month.

## Transfer While Travelling

Up till version 1.2.0 this feature was enabled by default.
From 1.3.0 onwards it is disabled by default (see [settings.json](data/config/settings.json)).
When enabled, it enables the player to easily retrieve and deposit cargo and ships from both main board and storage intel.
