# Stellar Logistics

Stellar Logistics allows for a convenient browsing of the player's storage content letting the player to quickly locate cargo and ships.
It also enables the player to easily retrieve and deposit cargo and ships (this feature can be disabled, enabled by default) from both main board and storage intel.
Any transfer of cargo or ships will incur a fee (depends on the distance between the player fleet and selected storage) that will be collected at the end of the month.
